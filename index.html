		<h1>(Un)common Ground</h1>
		<p id="time"></p>
		<p>Before we begin, let me ask are there any <span class="strike">Narragansett</span> or <span class="strike">Wampanoag</span> folks in the <span class="open"><span class="open">space</span></span>?</p>
		<p>How about any descendants of the roughly 100,000 <span class="strike"><span class="strike">people</span></span> sold into slavery in Rhode Is<span class="underline">land</span> in buildings like RISD’s Market House not more than 100 yards from here?</p>
		<p>No?</p>

		<p>Then before we can move <span class="italic">forward</span> we need to move toward some <span class="strike">common</span> <span class="underline">ground</span>.</p>

		<p>**<span class="caps">Whereas</span>** colonization is alive and well, built with brick and mortar into the very |walls| of this <span class="open">space</span> that refuses its <span class="strike">indigenous</span> inhabitants and the descendants of the <span class="strike">people</span> whose exploited labor made Providence possible yet received no providence of their own >>></p>

		<p>**<span class="caps">Whereas</span>** the communities from which my practice is <span class="underline">ground</span>ed are not present in this room to receive my words, offer guidance, or engage in dialogue regarding this declaration of my position >>></p>

		<p>**<span class="caps">Whereas</span>** this is not yet a <span class="strike">safe</span> <span class="open">space</span> for <span class="strike">liberation</span>, but an institutional <span class="open">space</span> founded in the imperialist, capitalist, white supremacist hetero-patriarchy >>></p>

		<p>**<span class="caps">Whereas</span>** I could neither destroy nor reclaim this <span class="open">space</span> without visiting violence sanctioned by the settler state upon me >>></p>

		<p>**<span class="caps">Whereas</span>** any <span class="underline">land</span> acknowledgement ceremony would only reify, not raze, structures of power and domination by recalling the violent act of colonization without holding the state accountable, unpacking our complicity, or rectifying the in<span class="strike">justice</span> >>></p>

		<p>**<span class="caps">Whereas</span>** any discussion concerning <span class="strike">decolonization</span> must be <span class="underline">ground</span>ed in <span class="underline">territory</span> >>></p>

		<p><span class="caps">I hereby claim</span> a new <span class="open">space</span>, a <span class="strike">sovereign</span> <span class="open">space</span>, a <span class="open">space</span> for all <span class="strike">beings</span> who recognize their <span class="strike">liberation</span> is bound up with mine. This is a <span class="open">space</span> defined not by |boundaries| or #demarcations# but through connections—and—commitments: to each other, to the <span class="underline">land</span>, to our <span class="super">ancestors</span>, and to <span class="strike">sustainable</span> <span class="strike">futurities</span>. This <span class="open">space</span>, our <span class="open">space</span> if we choose it, is a creative <span class="open">space</span>, a destructive <span class="open">space</span>, a subversive <span class="open">space</span>. It is a <span class="open">space</span> activated through individual and collective acts of <span class="strike">decolonization</span>.</p>

		<p>I claim this <span class="open">space</span> because without it I don’t know how to speak to you. Not because I don’t know how to talk about my practice or my personal position, but because until we find <span class="strike">common</span> <span class="underline">ground</span> I don’t know what my position is in <span class="strike">relation</span> to you. Even after four years studying design, I still have not figured out how to package something that is not meant for you. What’s more, I am reticent to render my labor legible to an institution that was not built for me. You see, we may be in the same room, but we occupy different <span class="open">space</span>s, and I know better than to expose my position to colonizers. I am holding this <span class="open">space</span> as a bridge, a liminal <span class="open">space</span> we activate through collective acts of making <span class="strike">common</span>. To co-habit a <span class="strike">common</span> <span class="open">space</span> we must reorient our relationship to each other.</p>

		<p>Are you with me?<br><span class="open">Are you with me?</span></p>

		<p>---</p>

		<p>This is where I’m from.</p>
		<img src="img/IMG_9050.JPG">

		<p>Standing Rock, North Dakota. To many it is an unremarkable <span class="open">place</span>, but to me it is a <span class="open">space</span> of immense complexity, mystery, possibility, and freedom. For literally millennia my ancestors have nourished themselves on this <span class="underline">land</span>, learned its lessons, survived its hardships, and returned to it in passing. It is the only <span class="open">place</span> I’ve felt a spiritual connection. It is more than a community, it is more than a <span class="open">place</span>, it is <span class="super">Wakȟáƞ</span>--sacred. It is also the <span class="underline">site</span> of post-colonial, post-apocalyptic trauma. In the span of a few decades the whole world my <span class="super">ancestors</span> knew came to a cataclysmic end. Most of what was destroyed will never be recovered. <span class="underline">Land</span> was stolen, ecosystems we had lived in balance with since time immemorial were inter\rupt/ed and sent into irreversible decline. Those of us that survived the genocidal violence were rounded up onto internment camps called reservations. Children were stolen from their families and <span class="open">place</span>d in Catholic boarding schools where they were stripped of their identity, taught to hate who they were and where they come from, and often subject to physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. The psychological impact colonization has had on my people is beyond the scope of what I can explain to you in the time we have together, but let it suffice to say colonization doesn’t just happen on <span class="underline">land</span>, it happens in the mind and in the spirit as well. Nevertheless, I am here. I marvel at the resilience of my people.</p>

		<p>On the other side of my family little is known about our history. My father was murdered before I was born, a victim of Oak<span class="underline">land</span>'s crack epidemic in the 80s. Of course, the term "epidemic" is too benign as it renders the culprit inculpable. The crack epidemic that took my father and my grandfather--after whom I’m named--should be referred to as chemical warfare since crack was intentionally introduced into impoverished Black and Brown communities by the US government for the purposes of destabilization and exploitation. There are no poppy-fields in the ghetto. The US government even referred to their response to this epidemic as the “war on drugs,” but Black folks knew the war on drugs was a war on us. What I do know of my history on my father’s side is that they fled to Oak<span class="underline">land</span> by way of Texas and Louisiana, finding refuge amongst the Seminole and Cherokee tribes.</p>

		<p>From that information I ascertained that my African <span class="sup">ancestors</span> were transported to Vespucci <span class="underline">land</span>, most likely from Nigeria, but that ancestry's been lost to me. Shackled, crammed hip-to-hip in unspeakable conditions down in the bowels of the ship, some ship captain triangulated our trajectory through the triangular trade, the real Bermuda Triangle, the one in which humans were made alien and free people made slaves. Through this middle passage I was transformed from Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo, Fulani to Nigger, Coon, Pickaninny, Spook, and every othering form in the White imagination. An indolent criminal, a lascivious predator, a monkey, a mule, an ever changing chimera to be subjugated and maimed. Along with the erasure of indigenous peoples and the invasion of White settlers (the only real immigrant invasion to happen on this continent), slavery was the pivotal third leg the structure of settler colonialism needed to stand. Without it there would not be enough labor to exploit the vast swathes of stolen fertile <span class="underline">land</span>. Through that violent geometry of immorality and greed my lineage was rendered inhuman in a lingering spectacle of inhumanity. Nevertheless, I am here. I marvel at the resilience of my people.</p>

		<p>I share this personal history with you to dispell any misconceived notion that settler colonialism was a singular event to be spoken of in the past-tense. Settler colonialism is an economic, social, and political structure. Its effects can be witnessed every day. We can speak to the spectacular instances that reveal its existence, from genocide and slavery to acts of resistance like NoDAPL and BlackLivesMatter. But it also works in ways that have become so common that we hardly recognize them, like the absence in this <span class="open">space</span> of Narraganset and Wampanoag folks or descendants of the bustling slave trade here in Rhode Is<span class="underline">land</span>.</p>

		<p>---</p>

		<p>My practice is rooted in de<span class="strike">colonization</span>. Often, that involves design. I have made of every prompt a battlefield; each stroke laid to canvas a new frontline in this ongoing struggle for liberation and non-<span class="strike">erasure</span>. I hope now standing on <span class="open">common</span> <span class="underline">ground</span> you can better relate to where I'm coming from.</p>

		<p>Design has the power to shape our ontological world view. It utilizes our senses to color our perception, which in turn is the lens through which we understand and shape our environment, our <span class="strike">institutions</span>, our actions, and our relationships.</p>

		<p>Can design de<span class="strike">colonize</span>? Can it really liberate us from the catastrophic specter of <span class="strike">oppression</span> that is the “<span class="strike">imperialist</span>, <span class="strike">capitalist</span>, <span class="strike">white supremacist</span> <span class="strike">hetero</span>-<span class="strike">patriarchy</span>?” The answer I’ve received from designers I trust has been unequivocally no. Then again, the difficult often seems impossible until it is accomplished. A century ago it would have been impossible for someone like me, someone of Black and/or Native ancestry to receive an education from a <span class="open">place</span> like RISD, until Nancy Prophet broke down that |barrier| and fabricated a new <span class="italic">futurity</span>. Through acts of destruction and creation, I am here. Nevertheless, I don’t find this framework to be useful. The immense human-made problems that have plagued us since the birth of the <span class="strike">settler colonial regime</span> have only increased in scale and complexity—there are no simple cures for deeply rooted systemic problems. But it is precisely because these issues are so complex—woven tightly into the fabric of our society and built directly into the architecture of our <span class="strike">institutions</span>—that design is an indispensable tool, methodology, and approach in the movements for de<span class="strike">colonization</span> and liberation. We need to creatively build new <span class="italic">futures</span> in the face of complexity and uncertainty. There are no small changes that can wrest us from the disastrous the path we are barreling down. A new course must be charted and good design can help us create the map. Great design can help us rethink ways of moving through the world altogether.</p>

		<p>The revolution will be designed. Movements for de<span class="strike">colonization</span> and liberation will require acts of destruction, creation, exploration, organization, reflection, and healing, actions which design is uniquely structured to perform. But, the way we practice design, particularly who we practice it for, needs to be de<span class="strike">colonized</span> metaphorically if it is going to serve anything other than the <span class="strike">settler state</span> and a <span class="strike">neo-liberal</span> agenda. Design needs to be redesigned. In fact, it needs to be redefined. Design as defined in the conventional canon, and as reified through professional practice, frames it as the translation of artistic forms for commercial use. I prefer the lens Tibor Kalman fashioned when he stated: "A designer is a professional liar because he's hired not to make the properties of a product clear but to enhance the product beyond its truth...Graphic designers think they're doing something else, making beautiful art, but it's not true." If commercial design is real design then the work we are doing at RISD is an artifice. I know many of you did not aspire to this application of design. I, like many other designers that come from traditionally <span class="strike">oppressed</span> and <span class="strike">marginalized</span> groups, do not see my communities or myself reflected in this definition of the <span class="underline">field</span>. Design needs to be redesigned, and constantly, for it is a tool that can be used in insidious ways even by well-meaning practitioners if wielded unconsciously. Writing is one powerful method of critique, as is conversation. But in my opinion, there is no stronger method of critiquing design than through design.</p>

		<p>My time at RISD will be best served building out methodological approaches to both metaphorically de<span class="strike">colonize</span> my design practice and literally de<span class="strike">colonize</span> my communities and myself. Towards that aim, these are the <span class="open">areas</span> I am cultivating relationships with in my design practice:</p>

		<p>1. design research >>> critical writing;</p>
		<p>2. urgent design >>> direct action >>> arte útile;</p>
		<p>3. speculative design >>> ethno-futurism >>> post-human design;</p>
		<p>4. emerging technologies >>> physical computing >>> simulation;</p>
		<p>5. communal <span class="open">spaces</span> and structures >>> innerwork.</p>

		<p>They are areas that help me address past >>> present >>> <span class="italic">future</span> issues caused by <span class="strike">colonization</span>. In naming these <span class="open">areas</span> of interest, my intention is not to define immutable |categories| or |delineate| |siloed| <span class="underline">fields</span>. In fact, I believe the most interesting work will exist in the wild unmapped lands existing between these |manufractured| <span class="open">spaces</span>. My only intention in defining these |categories| is to provide a vector for investigation. They are useful mental frameworks for exploration, critical discussion, and reconfiguration within my practice. The movements towards de<span class="strike">colonization</span> and liberation have been ongoing in indigenous <span class="open">spaces</span> around the world for many generations. I need not redraw the wheel, but rather draw from the well of knowledge provided by the <span class="underline">ground</span> breaking work of others. In this sense my practice and my thesis are also about the act of making familiar that which <span class="strike">colonization</span> has alienated to me. From this relationship I can <span class="underline">ground</span> my own practice and tailor methodologies to translate philosophical ideas into practice.</p>

		<p>Design that is in service of movements for social justice and de<span class="strike">colonization</span> need to be engaged rigorously. It cannot be a passive enterprise, the issues are too complex and there are too many pitfalls, amongst them:</p>
		<ul>
				<li>design that is self-serving or ineffective;</li>
				<li>design that exploits or makes more vulnerable the communities it is meant to serve;</li>
				<li>design or terminology that gets exploited, appropriated, misunderstood, or commodified;</li>
				<li>design as pastiche as elaborated by Imani Perry, in short, design that compresses the dimensionality of an issue and truncates information in such a way that it inhibits growth and connection. It is design that merely signifies action rather than catalyzes it.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>To do this work effectively, methodologies must be developed, critiqued, and adapted with the communities in which the practice is centered. <span class="strike">Colonialism</span> does not stand still, nor should our response to it.</p>

		<p>The post-apocalyptic <span class="open">space</span>s from which I come are primed for innovation; they can be a new <span class="open">space</span>, the fugitive under<span class="open">common</span>s spoken of by Moten and Harney. Yet, when I left my community to pursue a better education, I was led to believe I was entering a new and better world. A privileged world filled with endless possibility and opportunities. A world in which I would be made better and for which I should display my gratitude. But I realize now that the possibilities afforded on this sinking ship begin and end with the settler state, and opportunity is afforded only to those people who pay in compliance. Participating in academia, for all of it’s intellectual empowerment, has left me with the unsettling question “How do I get home from here?” Instead of liberated I feel trapped. It is an insidious system that would first refuse us and then <span class="strike">exploit</span> and redistribute the labor, capital, and brilliance of those of us it failed to keep out away from our communities and towards the maintenance of said system. We are being redirected to maintain systems of our own <span class="strike">oppression</span>. Let us not fight for seats at the table but rather refuse the design of a table built only to serve the few in the first <span class="open">place</span>. I would rather use my talents to disrupt, destroy, and rebuild than be <span class="strike">complicit</span> in the <span class="strike">oppression</span> of myself, my communities, and others. We should create a new <span class="italic">future</span> -- one that is informed by the past and steals from present <span class="strike">institutions</span>. A <span class="open">space</span> that exists alongside but not instead of or in relation to the <span class="strike">oppressive</span>, <span class="strike">unsustainable</span> edifice seeking to <span class="strike">co-opt</span> us. Let that world fail. Build for a wild ass beyond as instructed by Nora Khan. Let us expend our labor building for indigenous <span class="italic">futurities</span> for which we currently have no language, or as Andrea Smith says “Our project becomes less of one based on self-improvement or even collective self-improvement, and more about the creation of new worlds and <span class="italic">futurities</span> for which we currently have no language.” This is the design challenge that excites me, not critiquing or participating in an industry built to serve <span class="strike">capitalism</span>, not posturing in esoteric design for other designers. Let us make design that afflicts the comfortable and comforts the afflicted. Women, queer folks, people of color, the differently abled, we have done enough protesting. We have danced, marched, and sung until our lungs burned and our feet bled attesting our <span class="open">common</span> humanity. No more! Our insistance on life, dignity, and respect were met with violence, disgust, intolerance, and now superficial <span class="strike">co-opt</span>ation for capital gains. Our tokenized narratives of survival are <span class="underline">ground</span> into powder and wetted with white tears to be resold as salve to guilty consciences. No more critique. Steal, but do not serve. Be useful but do not be used. “Not so much the abolition of prisons but the abolition of a society that could have prisons, that could have slavery, that could have the wage, and therefore not abolition as the elimination of anything but abolition as the founding of a new society.” (Moten and Harney). Let the force of our example, the gravitas of our indigenous ingenuity, be the critique that dismantles the present <span class="strike">colonial</span> structures and builds a new <span class="open">common</span>s for all beings to inhabit, one built not on |barriers| or #demarcations#, but through our connections-and-commitments: to each other, to the <span class="underline">land</span>, to our <span class="super">ancestors</span>, and to sustainable <span class="italic">futurities</span>.</p>
